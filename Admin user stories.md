Add Doctors
Title:
As an admin, I want to add doctors to the portal, so that I can expand the available medical staff.

Acceptance Criteria:

The admin can navigate to a "Add Doctor" section.

The admin can input required doctor details (e.g., name, specialty, contact information).

The system validates the input fields (e.g., required fields are not empty, email format is correct).

Upon successful submission, the new doctor's profile is created and visible in the system.

A success message is displayed upon adding a doctor.

Priority: Medium
Story Points: 5
Notes:

Consider unique identifiers for doctors (e.g., email address, employee ID).

Think about what information is essential for a doctor's profile (e.g., schedule, services).

point n.4
Delete Doctor's Profile
Title:
As an admin, I want to delete a doctor's profile from the portal, so that I can remove outdated or incorrect information.

Acceptance Criteria:

The admin can select an existing doctor's profile from a list.

The admin is presented with a confirmation prompt before deletion.

Upon confirmation, the doctor's profile is permanently removed from the system.

A success message is displayed upon successful deletion.

Deleting a doctor's profile also handles associated data (e.g., future appointments, if applicable).

Priority: Medium
Story Points: 3
Notes:

Consider the impact of deleting a doctor on past appointments or historical data.

Soft delete (marking as inactive) could be an alternative to permanent deletion, depending on requirements.

point n.5
Track Appointment Usage Statistics
Title:
As an admin, I want to run a stored procedure in MySQL CLI to get the number of appointments per month, so that I can track usage statistics.

Acceptance Criteria:

The admin has access to the MySQL Command Line Interface (CLI).

The admin can execute a pre-defined stored procedure.

The stored procedure returns an accurate count of appointments for each month.

The output is clearly formatted and easy to interpret.

Priority: Low
Story Points: 8
Notes:

The stored procedure needs to be developed and tested.

Consider what date range the stored procedure should cover (e.g., last 12 months, custom range).

Future enhancements might include a graphical representation of these statistics within the portal.
